# inventory
inventory.py is a simple game inventory save system written in python. The inventory allows you to control what describes the items and store them. It also handles saving and loading inventories. I created this for practice in writing python and in practice in documenting with [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [sphynx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html)
