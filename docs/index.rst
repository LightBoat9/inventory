Inventory
=========

Inventory is a simple game save system written in python. The inventory allows you to control
what describes the items and store them. It also handles automatically loading previously
created inventories. I created this for practice in writing python and in practice in documenting
with `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and `sphynx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_
