Inventory
=========

inventory.py is a simple game inventory save system written in python. The inventory allows you to control
what describes the items and store them. It also handles saving and loading inventories. I created this for practice
in writing python and in practice in documenting with `readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and
`sphynx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_
